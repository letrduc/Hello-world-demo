## Tools to use

1. One common problem beginners run into when learning coding is setting up their computer! We know you're excited about programming right away, so we'll get to it by starting programming directly in the web browser, using two webapps, [CodePen](https://codepen.io) and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). You'll be able to start coding right away without installing anything on your computer.

2. Another pretty important tool is **Chrome DevTools** which is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.
